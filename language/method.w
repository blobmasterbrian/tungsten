// This file will discuss the syntax and guarantees of a method on an object

// Assumptions: Will use the basic function syntax proposed in function.w

// Proposal: Use the struct name, scope operator, then declare as you would
// a normal function.

// Example:
Vector::func Exists(const target int) => {}
// Usage
{1,2,3} -> nums Vector
5 -> ()Exists::nums -> ok

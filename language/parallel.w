// This file will discuss the language primitives around parallel programming.
// This is inherently related to the proposal on concurrency.

// Proposal: With the growing popularity of coroutines and the decline of OS threading
// outside of systems programming, more programmers are becoming familiar with the spawn/go
// keyword in terms of coroutines and not threading. As a result, an OS thread will be
// created explicitly using the keyword thread.
